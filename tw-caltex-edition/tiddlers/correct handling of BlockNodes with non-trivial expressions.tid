title: correct handling of BlockNodes with non-trivial expressions

multiline expressions like

```
<$caltex>
x=1+2
y=3+4
</$caltex>
```

should show as output

$$
x = 1 + 2 = 3\quad y = 3 + 4 = 7
$$

but currently only show

$$
x = 1 + 2 \quad y = 3 + 4
$$

this requires reimplementing handling of `BlockNode`s to evaluate each expression separately to add its  result at the end
