title: render simple assignments correctly

definitions like `x=1` are rendered as `x = 1 = 1`, which is correct but silly. Check for that case and show more reasonable output.

check implemented: see that: 

* the top node is an assignment node (`.type == "AssigmentNode"`)
* its only value is either a constant, or an array.
