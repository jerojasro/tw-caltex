title: support for units

* display units correctly
** as of now, they are just passed verbatim to katex; e.g.: `$$1.2 m$$`, which shows up as //1.2m//
* detect when the expression is merely the definition of a value and don't show the result twice
** `x = 1.2 m` is shown as `x = 1.2 m = 1.2 m` 
* document available units and SI prefixes (k, m, $$\mu$$, etc.)
